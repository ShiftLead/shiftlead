Every write reads its files, applies the module's edit (``edit_line``, ``item_line``, ``decided_line``,
``archive_closed``, ``canonical_item``, ``set_rank``), and writes the files back, both or neither. It
prints the commit subject the module gives and the paths it changed (``--json``: one object);
``--plan`` prints the changes as JSON (each path with its new text) and writes nothing. It never runs
git, the network or anything of a consumer's: the caller passes who replies or answers (``--by``), the date
(``--today``, default the local clock) and the tool and session the subject names, and makes the
commit itself. A write that leaves an open line (``add``, ``snooze``, ``due``, ``decide``, ``reply``) also reports
that line's notes (``item_notes()`` at ``--today``): ``item_notes`` in ``--json`` and ``--plan``, and on stderr as
``line n: ℹ <note>`` otherwise; a note never changes the exit code. A ``decide --board-only`` whose lifting
answer leaves a listed entry still carrying the gate writes nothing (v2.7): it reports ``left_open`` and prints
``left open: <ids> still carry <gate>`` on stderr in every mode.

Exit, the package's one table (``ledger.py`` shares it): 0 written (or nothing to change); 1 refused; 2 usage
(a bad ``--today`` among it), or (``decide`` and ``add --parts``) the ledger cannot be used as asked; 4 a write failed (every file restored). 3 is ``ledger.py``'s
``needs`` and never the board writer's.
